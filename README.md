# Web_Scraping_Challenge

## Description
In this challenge I utilized the web scraping tool BeautifulSoup to gather information from a site about mars.

### Deliverable 1 
I used web scraping methods to gather article titles and preview excerpts for each article on the page.

### Deliverable 2
In this I used Jupyter Notebook and BeautifulSoup to scrape a table on the same website containing Mars weather data. I was then able to translate that into my own DataFrame which I was then able to use for weather insights on Mars for the given time period.

## Resources
In this project I relied heavily on the Xpert Learning Assistant AI, I used small specific code bits from what it had provided. I used it more for a directional assistant. Otherwise I used all of the proivided class material to refresh myself and used code concepts to aid me in my challenge.
